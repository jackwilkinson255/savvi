# SAVVI

The Spatial Awareness Vest for the Visually Impaired (SAVVI) aims to enable blind and visually impaired people to
identify obstacles in their environment. The system was designed using a systematic approach, in which key subsystems were
identified and developed independently. Various psychophysical experiments were carried out to investigate how people
interpret vibrotactile stimuli and develop the haptics subsystem.
